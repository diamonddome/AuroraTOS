## I. Ownership of the App; Agreement to Terms of Service  

These Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service”) apply to the Aurora Overlay software application, related services, and all associated modules, documentation, updates, and support materials (collectively, the “App”). The App is the property of its developers (“Aurora Overlay,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and its licensors.  

BY USING THE APP, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT USE THE APP.  

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of these Terms of Service at any time. It is your responsibility to check these Terms of Service periodically for changes. Your continued use of the App following the posting of changes means that you accept and agree to those changes. As long as you comply with these Terms of Service, Aurora Overlay grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license (the “License”) to install and use the App in accordance with this Agreement.

## II. Content and Intellectual Property  

All text, graphics, interfaces, photographs, trademarks, logos, sounds, music, artwork, and computer code (collectively, the “Content”), including but not limited to the design, structure, selection, coordination, expression, “look and feel,” and arrangement of such Content contained in the App, is owned, controlled, or licensed by or to Aurora Overlay.  

The Content is protected by copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, unfair competition, and other intellectual property laws. Except as expressly provided in these Terms of Service, no Content may be copied, reproduced, republished, uploaded, posted, publicly displayed, encoded, translated, transmitted, or distributed in any way to any other computer, server, website, or medium for publication or distribution or for any commercial enterprise, without our express prior written consent.  

You may use information purposely made available by Aurora Overlay for downloading from within the App (such as user guides, FAQs, and similar materials), provided that you (1) do not remove any proprietary notice language in all copies, (2) use such information only for your personal, non-commercial informational purposes, (3) make no modifications to such information, and (4) do not make any additional representations or warranties relating to such documents.

## III. Restrictions on Use  

You may not use any deep-link, page-scrape, robot, spider, or other automatic device, program, algorithm, or methodology, or any similar or equivalent manual process, to access, acquire, copy, or monitor any portion of the App or any Content.  

You may not attempt to gain unauthorized access to any portion or feature of the App, or any other systems or networks connected to the App, by hacking, password mining, or any other illegitimate means.  

You may not probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of the App or any network connected to the App, nor breach the security or authentication measures on the App. You may not reverse look-up, trace, or seek to trace any information on any other user of the App to its source.  

You may not forge headers or otherwise manipulate identifiers in order to disguise the origin of any message you send to Aurora Overlay. You may not pretend that you are, or that you represent, someone else.  

You may not use the App or any Content for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms of Service, or to solicit the performance of any illegal activity or other activity that infringes the rights of Aurora Overlay or others.
