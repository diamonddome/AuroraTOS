## Limitation of Liability & Warranty Disclaimer

### No Warranty
The app, Aurora Overlay, is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE," without any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied. This includes, but is not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, or that the app will run uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components.

### Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent allowed by applicable law, the developers of Aurora Overlay, their affiliates, licensors, and service providers will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages; or for any loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to your use of–or inability to use–the app, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Our total aggregate liability for all claims related to Aurora Overlay will not exceed the greater of (a) US$100 or (b) the amount you actually paid us (if any) for access to the app in the twelve-month period preceding the event giving rise to the claim.
